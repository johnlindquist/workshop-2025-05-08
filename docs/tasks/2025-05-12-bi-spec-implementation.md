# Task: Implement BI Specification (Analytics and Metrics)

## Commit 1: feat: Configure basic analytics for web application ✅ 8fbf89d
**Description:**
Integrate Cloudflare Analytics into the Next.js web application (`apps/web/`). This involves adding the necessary Cloudflare script or configuration as per [Cloudflare Analytics documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/analytics/web-analytics/). The goal is to track page views and basic user interactions. Reference `docs/TECH_STACK.md` which lists Cloudflare Analytics as a preferred tool.

**Verification:**
Deploy the changes to a staging environment or test locally. Verify in the Cloudflare dashboard that web analytics data (page views, visitors) is being received from the application. Check browser console for any errors related to the analytics script.

## Commit 2: feat: Define and document initial technical success metrics ✅ 4b45937
**Description:**
Based on `docs/PRD.md` (Section 7: Success Metrics), define an initial set of technical success metrics. This involves creating or updating a section in `docs/PRD.md` or a new file (e.g., `docs/SUCCESS_METRICS.md`). Metrics should include:
- API endpoint usage (e.g., count of `/notes` POST, GET requests, referencing `docs/openapi.yaml`).
- API error rates (e.g., percentage of 4xx/5xx responses for key endpoints).
- Application load time (target TBD, can be informed by Cloudflare Analytics).
- Note creation/sync success rates.

**Verification:**
Review the documented metrics for clarity, measurability, and relevance to the project goals stated in `docs/PRD.md`. Ensure the chosen metrics can be tracked either via Cloudflare Analytics or backend logging.

## Commit 3: chore: Set up backend logging for API usage and errors ✅ 9cbf803
**Description:**
Implement logging in the Hono backend (`backend/src/`) to capture API request/response details and errors. This will facilitate tracking the metrics defined in Commit 2. Use `@hono/logger` as specified in `docs/TECH_STACK.md`. Ensure logs include enough detail (endpoint, status code, timestamp, potentially anonymized user identifiers if applicable and compliant with privacy) to calculate success metrics. Logs should be structured for potential future ingestion into a more advanced logging/monitoring system if needed.

**Verification:**
Run the backend locally and make API requests to various endpoints defined in `docs/openapi.yaml` (e.g., `POST /notes`, `GET /notes/{noteId}`). Check the console or log output to confirm that requests and any intentional errors are being logged correctly with sufficient detail. Ensure logs are formatted clearly.

## Commit 4: docs: Update project documentation with analytics and metrics info
**Description:**
Update relevant project documentation (`README.md`, `docs/TECH_STACK.md`, or a new `docs/MONITORING.md`) to reflect the analytics setup and the defined success metrics. This includes:
- How to access/interpret Cloudflare Analytics.
- Location and description of the defined technical success metrics.
- Overview of the backend logging strategy for API monitoring.
This ensures the team understands how to monitor the application's health and usage.

**Verification:**
Review the updated documentation for accuracy, completeness, and clarity. Ensure another developer could understand the analytics and metrics setup by reading the documentation.

## Commit 5: refactor: Initial dashboard/report stub for key metrics (Optional)
**Description:**
<!-- TODO: Depending on the capabilities of Cloudflare Analytics or other simple tools, investigate creating a very basic dashboard or recurring report stub. This could be a placeholder if direct tooling isn't immediately feasible. The goal is to make key metrics visible. If not feasible now, document how these metrics will be manually compiled initially. -->
Explore options for visualizing the key metrics. If Cloudflare Analytics provides sufficient dashboarding, configure a basic view. If not, create a template or script (e.g., a simple shell script to grep logs for counts, or a markdown template for manual reporting) as a placeholder for future dashboarding.

**Verification:**
<!-- TODO: Specify how to verify the dashboard/report stub. If it's a configured Cloudflare dashboard, verify it shows some data. If it's a script, run it and check its output. If it's a document, review its structure. -->
Verify that the chosen method for visualizing or reporting metrics is accessible and provides a basic overview of the defined success metrics.
