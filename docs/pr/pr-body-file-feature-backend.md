# Pull Request: Set Up Backend API with Hono on Cloudflare Workers

## Summary
This PR implements the initial backend for the note-taking app, following the project requirements and tech stack. The backend is built with Hono (Cloudflare Workers), uses Cloudflare KV for storage, and includes Zod validation, Vitest tests, Biome formatting, and Husky pre-commit hooks. All work was performed in micro-milestones with verification at each step.

## Key Changes
- Scaffolded the backend directory structure and TypeScript config.
- Initialized a Hono app with a `/health` endpoint.
- Integrated Cloudflare KV for `/notes` storage (GET/POST), with Zod validation.
- Added Vitest unit and integration tests for `/health` and `/notes` endpoints.
- Enforced Biome formatting and Husky pre-commit hooks for code quality.
- All endpoints and tests verified locally.

## Micro-Milestones & Verification
1. **Scaffold backend directory structure and config**
   - Created `backend/src/`, `index.ts`, and ensured TypeScript config.
   - Verified by compiling with `pnpm tsc -p backend/tsconfig.json`.
2. **Initialize Hono app and basic API route**
   - Installed Hono and set up `/health` endpoint.
   - Verified by running with Wrangler and `curl http://localhost:8787/health`.
3. **Integrate Cloudflare KV for note storage**
   - Added KV binding in `wrangler.toml` and implemented `/notes` GET/POST.
   - Verified by local tests and manual curl requests.
4. **Add Vitest unit and integration tests for API**
   - Added tests for `/health` and `/notes` endpoints, including validation errors.
   - Verified by running `pnpm vitest run --dir backend` (all tests passing).
5. **Add Biome config and enforce formatting with Husky**
   - Ensured Biome formatting and Husky pre-commit hooks are enforced.
   - Verified by running `pnpm biome check backend/` and making a sample commit.

## Additional Notes
- All code is TypeScript and follows monorepo conventions.
- Logging and error handling are in place for observability.
- All requirements from `docs/PRD.md`, `docs/TECH_STACK.md`, and `docs/STRUCTURE.md` were followed.
