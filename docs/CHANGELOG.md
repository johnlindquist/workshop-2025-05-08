# Project Changelog

## Project Update: BI Specification Implementation (2025-05-12)

### Avoidable Failures
- **Incorrect Package Name:** Initially attempted to install `@hono/logger`, which resulted in a 404 error. A web search revealed the correct import is `hono/logger` (part of the main `hono` package).
- **Tooling Issues (`edit_file`):** The `edit_file` tool repeatedly truncated the task markdown file (`docs/tasks/2025-05-12-bi-spec-implementation.md`) when adding completion markers. This required manual restoration of the file content multiple times.

### Changes to Project Behavior/Expectations
- **Web Analytics:** Cloudflare Web Analytics script has been added to `apps/web/app/layout.tsx`. Requires manual configuration of the Cloudflare token (`YOUR_TOKEN_HERE` placeholder).
- **Success Metrics:** Technical success metrics (API usage, error rates, performance) are now formally defined in `docs/PRD.md`, Section 7.
- **Backend Logging:** The Hono backend (`backend/src/index.ts`) now uses the built-in `logger` middleware to log request/response details to the console.
- **Monitoring Documentation:** A new file, `docs/MONITORING.md`, has been created to document the analytics setup, success metrics location, logging strategy, and initial manual reporting process.
- **Metrics Reporting:** The initial approach for reporting key technical metrics will involve manual analysis of Cloudflare Analytics data and backend console logs, as documented in `docs/MONITORING.md`.
